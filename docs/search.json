    "section": "Case Study",
    "text": "Case Study\nThere has been a significant increase in the availability of biodiversity data, largely driven by technological advances. According to the article “Historical Redlining is Associated with Increasing Geographical Disparities in Bird Biodiversity Sampling in the United States,” a study shows that digital collections created by citizen scientists using cellphone apps, such as eBird, tend to be spatially biased. Specifically, higher-income areas are overrepresented while low-income areas are undersampled (Ellis-Soto, Chapman, and Locke 2023). Although this issue may seem minor, databases like eBird play a critical role in conservation decisions. This bias can dramatically affect measurements of biodiversity change, making it more difficult to accurately map and forecast species distributions.\nCitizen science plays a vital role in monitoring biodiversity, but relying solely on it for conservation planning and resource allocation can introduce bias and negatively impact biodiversity, particularly in underrepresented areas. Research has indicated that eBird activity correlates with income and racial demographics at the census tract level. As a result, bird populations are often undersampled in lower-income communities, reflecting a bias in sampling associated with historical redlining (Grade et al. 2022). This raises concerns about the missing data that could significantly impact these excluded communities. Moreover, there is a notable disparity between the racial composition of the general public and the birdwatching community, which predominantly consists of white individuals, with very limited representation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (Rutter et al. 2021). As mentioned earlier, the long-term effects of historical redlining have fostered predominantly white neighborhoods, which helps explain why eBird data may not accurately represent the broader population.\neBird has implemented a diverse range of products, including outreach materials, environmental assessments, and conservation plans. According to the article “Using Open Access Observational Data for Conservation Action: A Case Study for Birds,” eBird has played a crucial role in species assessments, such as identifying the rufa Red Knot as a threatened species and implementing policies to restrict wind energy in certain areas (Sullivan et al. 2017). However, it is noted that eBird has not yet reached a sufficiently large audience. To realize its full potential, intensive partnership building, a strong community, and time will be necessary. Although these products positively impact environmental science, there is a risk from using a platform that has poorly conducted data, which can potentially misinform policy and practice (Konno et al. 2024). Biased bird observation data can be problematic because it may introduce inaccuracies that could affect our understanding of conservation priorities and ultimately lead to the decline or even extinction of truly threatened species populations."

    "text": "Reflection\nThere are two significant sources of bias present in the eBird data: availability bias and volunteer bias. Availability bias occurs when we rely on the most readily accessible data—in this case, the eBird app. As a result, the data may not adequately represent the target population as intended. On the other hand, volunteer bias arises when participants in a study have traits that differ from the general population of interest (Nunan, Heneghan, et al. 2017--2024). In this context, it pertains to the socioeconomic status of bird watchers. Determining representativeness is complicated when the available data does not capture the relevant characteristics of either the sampled users or the larger population (Olteanu et al. 2019). These biases pose significant limitations to the use of the data due to uncertainties and cold spots. Furthermore, they raise ethical concerns, as the eBird observations may reflect patterns of redlining.\n\nHow can we address redlining when the necessary data is lacking?\n\nHow might this missing data affect the allocation of resources for disadvantaged areas?\n\nAlthough it may not be intentional, how can we bridge the socioeconomic gap among birdwatchers?\n\nScientists, policymakers, the general public, and the eBird platform should carefully consider how they utilize bird observation datasets and seek ways to improve these disparities."

    "text": "Solutions\nTo promote equitable biodiversity research and conservation, it is crucial to align scientific goals with community-led initiatives. By prioritizing the improvement of biodiversity sampling in underrepresented regions, often referred to as coldspots, and collaborating with neighborhood associations and non-governmental groups, we can encourage inclusive citizen science. Programs like STEM-focused initiatives for high school students, Black Birders Week, and Latino Outdoors are examples of how engaging marginalized communities can enhance scientific literacy and encourage broader participation in nature-based activities. Furthermore, by leveraging federal initiatives like Justice40, resources can be directed to historically underserved communities, empowering them with K-12 STEM education and promoting active involvement in conservation efforts.​ Until we see a change in the data that reflects the population, tools like eBird can eventually be used to improve environmental science and policy. By embracing these strategies, we can develop a more inclusive and informed approach to biodiversity conservation."

    "text": "About\nThe Thomas Fire, which affected both Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in December 2017, is historically significant as one of the largest fires in that time period. The fire was ignited by high winds that caused power lines to touch, creating an electrical arc that deposited molten material onto the ground, igniting nearby vegetation. In total, the fire burned 281,893 acres, destroyed 1,063 structures, and resulted in two fatalities—a firefighter and a civilian. Additionally, the Thomas Fire caused long-term environmental impacts, resulting in widespread ecological damage and the displacement of communities."

    "text": "Analyze the AQI of 2017\nFirst, it is essential that we import the necessary Python libraries. For this analysis, we will be using the pandas library for data manipulation.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nNow, we can read the datasets, saved as CSV files, using the pandas command pd.read_csv and assign them to a concise variable name.\n\naqi_17 = pd.read_csv(\"data/daily_aqi/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip\", compression = \"zip\")\naqi_18 = pd.read_csv(\"data/daily_aqi/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip\", compression = \"zip\")\n\nBy setting the compression argument to “zip,” pandas will first decompress the zip file and then create a DataFrame from the CSV file contained within the zipped file. The datasets are named according to their corresponding year.\nNext, it is important to combine both dataframes to analyze the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the Thomas Fire, which started in 2017 and continued into early 2018. In this case, we can simply place the 2017 dataset on top of the 2018 dataset using the pandas command pd.concat.\n\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\nNow that we have a single DataFrame with all the AQI data, we can clean it up by: 1. Simplifying the column names\n\naqi.columns = (aqi.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ','_'))\n\n\nFiltering the data to include only Santa Barbara County\n\n\naqi_sb = aqi[aqi[\"county_name\"] == \"Santa Barbara\"]\n\n\nRemoving any unnecessary columns\n\n\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.loc[:, \"date\":\"number_of_sites_reporting\"]\n\n\nEnsuring that all variables have the correct data types\n\n\naqi_sb[\"date\"] = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb[\"date\"])\n\n\nIndexing and arranging the data in chronological order\n\n\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.set_index(\"date\").sort_index()\n\nThe output should produce a DataFrame that is ready for analysis. Since we want to examine AQI throughout 2017, we need to consider both the daily AQI values and the 5-day AQI averages. To achieve this, we will create a new column for the 5-day averages. By applying a rolling mean to calculate them, we can effectively analyze and identify trends in the time series.\n\naqi_sb[\"five_day_average\"] = aqi_sb[\"aqi\"].rolling(window = \"5D\").mean()\n\nFinally, we can plot both the daily and 5-day average AQI to analyze how air quality has changed over time and to visualize the effect of the Thomas Fire that occurred at the end of 2017.\n\nax = aqi_sb.loc[\"2017\"].plot(y = [\"aqi\", \"five_day_average\"],\n                             xlabel = \" \",\n                             ylabel = \"AQI (values of index)\",\n                             title = \"Santa Barbara County Air Quality Index for the Year 2017\",\n                             kind = \"line\",\n                             color=[\"red\", \"blue\"])\n\nax.legend([\"Daily\", \"5-Day Average\"])\n\nfig = ax.get_figure()  # Get the Matplotlib figure object\nfig.savefig(\"sb_aqi_2017_plot.png\", dpi=300, bbox_inches=\"tight\")"

After testing different approaches, I selected line plots, lollipop charts, and maps because they effectively highlighted the key patterns in my dataset.\nTo enhance engagement, I used a cohesive beach theme, incorporating natural elements such as shells, bird tracks, and rocks to create a familiar and inviting visual context.\n\nLine Plot (Abundance Over Time): I modified the design to resemble a shoreline, using shading techniques to mimic ocean tides. One challenge was making the shaded area under the line appear natural in a 2D visualization.\nLollipop Chart (Abundance by Georegion): To depict abundance across California’s regions, I positioned the hermit crabs at varying distances along a beach background. One of the biggest challenges was correctly flipping the chart in R to align counts from north to south.\nMaps (Species Distribution): Using a simple California basemap, I differentiated survey years using red and black markers, making it easy to spot changes in species presence and absence across MARINe sites.\n\nAnother major design decision was the layout of the infographic. I divided it into two sections, placing 2004 on the left and 2024 on the right, with the lollipop chart acting as a visual divider. This structure helps guide the audience through the data, making it clear how distributions and abundances have changed over time."
