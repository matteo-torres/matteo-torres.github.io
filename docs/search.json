I recently relocated to pursue a Master’s in Environmental Data Science (MEDS) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nI am interested in learning new data science skills to address complex environmental issues, particularly those related to ecology, conservation, and restoration. Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing, attending concerts, and listening to various music genres. Feel free to look around and get to know me better!"

    "text": "Background\nLos Angeles County is home to over 9 million people. Approximately 30% of the population identifies as people of color, and about 14% are considered low income. Many of these individuals are affected by historical redlining, which has led to the segregation of communities. Redlining originated from the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades introduced in the 1930s, which primarily benefited affluent white neighborhoods. This practice has resulted in unequal access to resources and disparities in the quality of life for many residents of Los Angeles.\nThe purpose of this study is to statistically analyze current data reflecting how pollutants and socioeconomic factors may relate to life expectancy in LA County. My goal is to identify trends that enhance our understanding of the current situation in communities that have historically faced disparities."

    "text": "About the data\nI will be using data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for this analysis. Specifically, I will work with a CSV file from the State EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool at the block group level.\n\nDependent Variable\n\nLow Life Expectancy: This measure identifies areas where life expectancy is lower than national averages. EJScreen utilizes an inverse approach, where higher values correspond to lower life expectancy and lower scores indicate higher life expectancy. The percentage of Low Life Expectancy is calculated using the formula:\n\n% Low Life Expectancy = 1 - (Life Expectancy / Max Life Expectancy)\n\n\nIndependent Variables\nEnvironmental Burden Indicators\n\nParticulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5): This metric quantifies potential exposure to fine particulate matter (2.5 micrometers or smaller) and is expressed as the annual average concentration in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.\nOzone: The ozone indicator in EJScreen version 2.3 reflects the annual mean of the 10 highest daily maximum 8-hour (MDA8) ozone concentrations.\nHazardous Waste Proximity: This indicator considers the total number of hazardous waste facilities within a 10-kilometer radius of the average resident in each block group, adjusted for distance. It is calculated as a population-weighted average of the blocks within each block group.\n\nSocioeconomic Indicators\n\nPeople of Color: This group includes individuals who identify their racial status as a race other than “white alone” and/or identify their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino.\nLow Income: A household is classified as low income if its income is equal to or less than twice the poverty level, which is defined as $29,950 by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nThis tool is not designed to provide a comprehensive risk analysis. Instead, it serves as a screening tool to explore important issues related to environmental justice.\nIt is based on demographic and environmental estimates that carry a considerable degree of uncertainty, particularly when analyzing small geographic areas."
