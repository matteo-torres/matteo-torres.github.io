    "text": "Background\nLos Angeles County, home to approximately 9.6 million residents, is one of the most diverse regions in the United States. About 30% of its population identifies as people of color, and around 14% are classified as low-income or living in poverty (US Census). Many of these individuals have been adversely affected by the generational impact of historical redlining, a practice that began in the 1930s under the Home Owners‚Äô Loan Corporation (HOLC).\nThe term ‚Äúredlining‚Äù originates from HOLC‚Äôs use of color-coded maps to rank neighborhoods, with green designated as the best and red labeled as hazardous. This practice systematically deepened racial segregation, excluding communities of color from neighborhoods deemed ‚Äúgreen,‚Äù and primarily benefiting white individuals and neighborhoods. As a result, perceptions of neighborhoods shifted, along with the allocation of resources, living conditions, and overall quality of life for those in red areas.\nEvidence suggests that the HOLC grading system is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes and poorer environmental characteristics in present-day neighborhoods (Swope). Some of these include higher levels of pollution, limited access to healthy food, and increased surface temperatures. Despite the passage of time, many residents of Los Angeles continue to bear the consequences of living in these historically redlined areas, which have seen little to no improvement in quality.\nThe purpose of this study is to statistically analyze current data to understand how pollutants and socioeconomic factors may correlate with life expectancy in Los Angeles County. My goal is to identify trends that deepen our understanding of the current situation in communities that have historically experienced disparities."

    "text": "About the Data\nFor this study, I chose to utilize the EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool dataset provided by the Environmental Protection Agency. This CSV file contains a variety of variables that assess different environmental burden indicators, socioeconomic indicators, and health disparity indicators, with Census block groups serving as the primary geographic unit.\nTo begin my analysis, it is essential to filter the dataset to include only observations from Los Angeles County, select the relevant variables for measurement, and remove any entries with missing data.\n\nDependent Variable\nThe primary focus of this statistical analysis is to measure how life expectancy responds to environmental and socioeconomic factors.\n\nLow Life Expectancy: This measure identifies areas where life expectancy is lower than the national average.\n\nEJScreen employs an inverse approach, where higher values correspond to lower life expectancy, and lower scores indicate higher life expectancy. The percentage of low life expectancy is calculated using the formula:\n% Low Life Expectancy = 1 - (Life Expectancy / Max Life Expectancy)\n\n\nIndependent Variables\nEnvironmental Burden Indicators\n\nParticulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5): This metric quantifies potential exposure to fine particulate matter (2.5 micrometers or smaller) and is expressed as the annual average concentration in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.\nOzone: The ozone indicator in EJScreen reflects the annual mean of the 10 highest daily maximum 8-hour (MDA8) ozone concentrations.\nHazardous Waste Proximity: This indicator considers the total number of hazardous waste facilities within a 10-kilometer radius of the average resident in each block group, adjusted for distance. It is calculated as a population-weighted average of the blocks within each block group.\n\nSocioeconomic Indicators\n\nPeople of Color: This group includes individuals who identify as a race other than ‚Äúwhite alone‚Äù and/or identify their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino.\nLow Income: A household is classified as low income if its income is equal to or less than twice the poverty level, defined as $29,950 by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\nLimitations\nBefore continuing onto my analysis plan, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the limitations of the EJScreen dataset.\n\nThis tool is not intended to provide a comprehensive risk analysis. Instead, it functions as a screening tool to examine certain issues related to environmental justice. It does not encompass all relevant issues that should be considered, and it strives to balance the need for data quality and national coverage while including as many significant environmental factors as possible within the constraints of available resources.\nThe dataset relies on demographic and environmental estimates that carry a considerable degree of uncertainty, especially when analyzing smaller geographic areas."

There is also a moderately positive association between the percentage of people of color and the percentage of low-income individuals. However, there is a moderate negative association between hazardous waste proximity and the ozone indicator.\nWhile these moderate relationships may provide insights into the situation in Los Angeles County, we cannot assume that correlation implies causation. It is essential to further analyze the data in different ways to gain a clearer understanding of whether these relationships are causal.\n\n\nRegression Models\nModel 1: Simple Regression\nlm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf, data = los_angeles)\n\nSimple Regression Model\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

The negative coefficient for ozone suggests that areas with higher ozone levels tend to have lower life expectancy. On the other hand, the positive coefficient for proximity to hazardous waste sites indicates that regions closer to these sites also tend to have lower life expectancy. However, the model explains only about 6.1% of the variation in life expectancy, which implies it may not fully account for all the factors influencing this outcome. There may be other variables not included in the model that could have a more substantial impact on life expectancy.\nModel 2: Multiple Regression\nlm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + peopcolorpct + lowincpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nMultiple Regression Model\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

This indicates that higher pollution levels are linked to lower life expectancy. Additionally, communities located closer to hazardous waste sites also tend to have lower life expectancy. The analysis reveals that higher percentages of people of color and low-income individuals are associated with lower life expectancy, highlighting the compounded effects of environmental and socioeconomic factors in vulnerable communities. The model now accounts for approximately 24.8% of the variation in life expectancy, which is a significant improvement over the previous model. This suggests that incorporating both environmental and socioeconomic variables has enhanced the model‚Äôs fit.\nModel 3: Interaction Effects (PM 2.5)\n(lm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + lowincpct + peopcolorpct + pm25:lowincpct + pm25:peopcolorpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nInteraction Effects (PM 2.5)\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

It suggests that in communities with higher percentages of people of color, the harmful effects of PM 2.5 on life expectancy are more pronounced. However, there is no significant interaction effect between particulate matter levels and the percentage of low-income individuals in predicting life expectancy. This model explains approximately 25.02% of the variability in life expectancy. Although the explanatory power of the model has slightly improved with the addition of interaction terms, it still does not account for a large portion of the variation in life expectancy, indicating that additional factors or more advanced modeling may be needed.\nModel 3: Interaction Effects (Ozone)\n(lm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + lowincpct + peopcolorpct + ozone:lowincpct + ozone:peopcolorpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nInteraction Effects (Ozone)\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

In contrast, the interaction between ozone levels and the percentage of low-income individuals is not significant, suggesting that income levels do not influence the negative effects of ozone on life expectancy. Approximately 27.73% of the variability in life expectancy is explained by this model, which shows an improvement to previous models, likely due to the inclusion of interaction terms.\nModel 3: Interaction Effects (Hazardous Waste Proximity)\n(lm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + lowincpct + peopcolorpct + ptsdf:lowincpct + ptsdf:peopcolorpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nInteraction Effects (Hazardous Waste Proximity)\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.Error\nt-value\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.094e-01\n5.169e-03\n40.513\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\npm25\n-1.008e-03\n3.003e-04\n-3.358\n0.000791\n\n\nozone\n-7.771e-04\n5.053e-05\n-15.380\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nptsdf\n-1.352e-05\n1.613e-04\n-0.084\n0.933184\n\n\nlowincpct\n7.232e-02\n6.077e-03\n11.899\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\npeopcolorpct\n3.094e-02\n4.551e-03\n6.798\n1.16e-11\n\n\nptsdf:lowincpct\n-1.178e-03\n2.779e-04\n-4.238\n2.29e-05\n\n\nptsdf:peopcolorpct\n2.720e-04\n2.281e-04\n1.193\n0.233109\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-squared: 0.25\n\n\nAccording to this interaction model, the significant interaction effect indicates that low-income communities are more vulnerable to the negative impacts of living near hazardous waste sites. In contrast, the non-significant interaction between proximity to hazardous waste and the percentage of people of color suggests that the racial composition of a neighborhood does not significantly influence the health effects of living near these sites. The model accounts for approximately 25% of the variance in life expectancy.\nFurther exploration of potential interactions between other environmental pollutants and socioeconomic factors could provide deeper insights. This exploration may reveal instances of omitted variable bias, which occurs when an important factor is left out of the analysis. Additionally, we could consider model improvements by incorporating variations of effects from other variables and interactions to enhance the overall the analysis."
