    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nLos Angeles County, home to approximately 9.6 million residents, is one of the most diverse regions in the United States. About 30% of its population identifies as people of color, and around 14% are classified as low-income or living in poverty (US Census). Many of these individuals have been adversely affected by the generational impact of historical redlining, a practice that began in the 1930s under the Home Owners‚Äô Loan Corporation (HOLC).\nThe term ‚Äúredlining‚Äù originates from HOLC‚Äôs use of color-coded maps to rank neighborhoods, with green designated as the best and red labeled as hazardous. This practice systematically deepened racial segregation, excluding communities of color from neighborhoods deemed ‚Äúgreen,‚Äù and primarily benefiting white individuals and neighborhoods. As a result, perceptions of neighborhoods shifted, along with the allocation of resources, living conditions, and overall quality of life for those in red areas.\nEvidence suggests that the HOLC grading system is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes and poorer environmental characteristics in present-day neighborhoods (Swope). Some of these include higher levels of pollution, limited access to healthy food, and increased surface temperatures. Despite the passage of time, many residents of Los Angeles continue to bear the consequences of living in these historically redlined areas, which have seen little to no improvement in quality.\nThe purpose of this study is to statistically analyze current data to understand how pollutants and socioeconomic factors may correlate with life expectancy in Los Angeles County. My goal is to identify trends that deepen our understanding of the current situation in communities that have historically experienced disparities."

    "text": "About the Data\nFor this study, I chose to utilize the EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool dataset provided by the Environmental Protection Agency. This CSV file contains a variety of variables that assess different environmental burden indicators, socioeconomic indicators, and health disparity indicators, with Census block groups serving as the primary geographic unit.\nTo begin my analysis, it is essential to filter the dataset to include only observations from Los Angeles County, select the relevant variables for measurement, and remove any entries with missing data.\n\nDependent Variable\nThe primary focus of this statistical analysis is to measure how life expectancy responds to environmental and socioeconomic factors.\n\nLow Life Expectancy: This measure identifies areas where life expectancy is lower than the national average.\n\nEJScreen employs an inverse approach, where higher values correspond to lower life expectancy, and lower scores indicate higher life expectancy. The percentage of low life expectancy is calculated using the formula:\n% Low Life Expectancy = 1 - (Life Expectancy / Max Life Expectancy)\n\n\nIndependent Variables\nEnvironmental Burden Indicators\n\nParticulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5): This metric quantifies potential exposure to fine particulate matter (2.5 micrometers or smaller) and is expressed as the annual average concentration in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter.\nOzone: The ozone indicator in EJScreen reflects the annual mean of the 10 highest daily maximum 8-hour (MDA8) ozone concentrations.\nHazardous Waste Proximity: This indicator considers the total number of hazardous waste facilities within a 10-kilometer radius of the average resident in each block group, adjusted for distance. It is calculated as a population-weighted average of the blocks within each block group.\n\nSocioeconomic Indicators\n\nPeople of Color: This group includes individuals who identify as a race other than ‚Äúwhite alone‚Äù and/or identify their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino.\nLow Income: A household is classified as low income if its income is equal to or less than twice the poverty level, defined as $29,950 by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\n\nLimitations\nBefore continuing onto my analysis plan, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the limitations of the EJScreen dataset.\n\nThis tool is not intended to provide a comprehensive risk analysis. Instead, it functions as a screening tool to examine certain issues related to environmental justice. It does not encompass all relevant issues that should be considered, and it strives to balance the need for data quality and national coverage while including as many significant environmental factors as possible within the constraints of available resources.\nThe dataset relies on demographic and environmental estimates that carry a considerable degree of uncertainty, especially when analyzing smaller geographic areas."

There is also a moderately positive association between the percentage of people of color and the percentage of low-income individuals. However, there is a moderate negative association between hazardous waste proximity and the ozone indicator.\nWhile these moderate relationships may provide insights into the situation in Los Angeles County, we cannot assume that correlation implies causation. It is essential to further analyze the data in different ways to gain a clearer understanding of whether these relationships are causal.\n\n\nRegression Models\nModel 1: Simple Regression\nlm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf, data = los_angeles)\n\nSimple Regression Model\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

The negative coefficient for ozone suggests that areas with higher ozone levels tend to have lower life expectancy. On the other hand, the positive coefficient for proximity to hazardous waste sites indicates that regions closer to these sites also tend to have lower life expectancy. However, the model explains only about 6.1% of the variation in life expectancy, which implies it may not fully account for all the factors influencing this outcome. There may be other variables not included in the model that could have a more substantial impact on life expectancy.\nModel 2: Multiple Regression\nlm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + peopcolorpct + lowincpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nMultiple Regression Model\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

This indicates that higher pollution levels are linked to lower life expectancy. Additionally, communities located closer to hazardous waste sites also tend to have lower life expectancy. The analysis reveals that higher percentages of people of color and low-income individuals are associated with lower life expectancy, highlighting the compounded effects of environmental and socioeconomic factors in vulnerable communities. The model now accounts for approximately 24.8% of the variation in life expectancy, which is a significant improvement over the previous model. This suggests that incorporating both environmental and socioeconomic variables has enhanced the model‚Äôs fit.\nModel 3: Interaction Effects (PM 2.5)\n(lm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + lowincpct + peopcolorpct + pm25:lowincpct + pm25:peopcolorpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nInteraction Effects (PM 2.5)\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

It suggests that in communities with higher percentages of people of color, the harmful effects of PM 2.5 on life expectancy are more pronounced. However, there is no significant interaction effect between particulate matter levels and the percentage of low-income individuals in predicting life expectancy. This model explains approximately 25.02% of the variability in life expectancy. Although the explanatory power of the model has slightly improved with the addition of interaction terms, it still does not account for a large portion of the variation in life expectancy, indicating that additional factors or more advanced modeling may be needed.\nModel 3: Interaction Effects (Ozone)\n(lm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + lowincpct + peopcolorpct + ozone:lowincpct + ozone:peopcolorpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nInteraction Effects (Ozone)\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.

In contrast, the interaction between ozone levels and the percentage of low-income individuals is not significant, suggesting that income levels do not influence the negative effects of ozone on life expectancy. Approximately 27.73% of the variability in life expectancy is explained by this model, which shows an improvement to previous models, likely due to the inclusion of interaction terms.\nModel 3: Interaction Effects (Hazardous Waste Proximity)\n(lm(lifeexppct ~ pm25 + ozone + ptsdf + lowincpct + peopcolorpct + ptsdf:lowincpct + ptsdf:peopcolorpct, data = los_angeles)\n\nInteraction Effects (Hazardous Waste Proximity)\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nStd.Error\nt-value\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.094e-01\n5.169e-03\n40.513\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\npm25\n-1.008e-03\n3.003e-04\n-3.358\n0.000791\n\n\nozone\n-7.771e-04\n5.053e-05\n-15.380\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\nptsdf\n-1.352e-05\n1.613e-04\n-0.084\n0.933184\n\n\nlowincpct\n7.232e-02\n6.077e-03\n11.899\n&lt; 2e-16\n\n\npeopcolorpct\n3.094e-02\n4.551e-03\n6.798\n1.16e-11\n\n\nptsdf:lowincpct\n-1.178e-03\n2.779e-04\n-4.238\n2.29e-05\n\n\nptsdf:peopcolorpct\n2.720e-04\n2.281e-04\n1.193\n0.233109\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-squared: 0.25\n\n\nAccording to this interaction model, the significant interaction effect indicates that low-income communities are more vulnerable to the negative impacts of living near hazardous waste sites. In contrast, the non-significant interaction between proximity to hazardous waste and the percentage of people of color suggests that the racial composition of a neighborhood does not significantly influence the health effects of living near these sites. The model accounts for approximately 25% of the variance in life expectancy.\nFurther exploration of potential interactions between other environmental pollutants and socioeconomic factors could provide deeper insights. This exploration may reveal instances of omitted variable bias, which occurs when an important factor is left out of the analysis. Additionally, we could consider model improvements by incorporating variations of effects from other variables and interactions to enhance the overall the analysis."

    "section": "Case Study",
    "text": "Case Study\nThere has been a significant increase in the availability of biodiversity data, largely driven by technological advances. According to the article ‚ÄúHistorical Redlining is Associated with Increasing Geographical Disparities in Bird Biodiversity Sampling in the United States,‚Äù a study shows that digital collections created by citizen scientists using cellphone apps, such as eBird, tend to be spatially biased. Specifically, higher-income areas are overrepresented while low-income areas are undersampled (Ellis-Soto, Chapman, and Locke 2023). Although this issue may seem minor, databases like eBird play a critical role in conservation decisions. This bias can dramatically affect measurements of biodiversity change, making it more difficult to accurately map and forecast species distributions.\nCitizen science plays a vital role in monitoring biodiversity, but relying solely on it for conservation planning and resource allocation can introduce bias and negatively impact biodiversity, particularly in underrepresented areas. Research has indicated that eBird activity correlates with income and racial demographics at the census tract level. As a result, bird populations are often undersampled in lower-income communities, reflecting a bias in sampling associated with historical redlining (Grade et al. 2022). This raises concerns about the missing data that could significantly impact these excluded communities. Moreover, there is a notable disparity between the racial composition of the general public and the birdwatching community, which predominantly consists of white individuals, with very limited representation of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (Rutter et al. 2021). As mentioned earlier, the long-term effects of historical redlining have fostered predominantly white neighborhoods, which helps explain why eBird data may not accurately represent the broader population.\neBird has implemented a diverse range of products, including outreach materials, environmental assessments, and conservation plans. According to the article ‚ÄúUsing Open Access Observational Data for Conservation Action: A Case Study for Birds,‚Äù eBird has played a crucial role in species assessments, such as identifying the rufa Red Knot as a threatened species and implementing policies to restrict wind energy in certain areas (Sullivan et al. 2017). However, it is noted that eBird has not yet reached a sufficiently large audience. To realize its full potential, intensive partnership building, a strong community, and time will be necessary. Although these products positively impact environmental science, there is a risk from using a platform that has poorly conducted data, which can potentially misinform policy and practice (Konno et al. 2024). Biased bird observation data can be problematic because it may introduce inaccuracies that could affect our understanding of conservation priorities and ultimately lead to the decline or even extinction of truly threatened species populations."

    "text": "Reflection\nThere are two significant sources of bias present in the eBird data: availability bias and volunteer bias. Availability bias occurs when we rely on the most readily accessible data‚Äîin this case, the eBird app. As a result, the data may not adequately represent the target population as intended. On the other hand, volunteer bias arises when participants in a study have traits that differ from the general population of interest (Nunan, Heneghan, et al. 2017--2024). In this context, it pertains to the socioeconomic status of bird watchers. Determining representativeness is complicated when the available data does not capture the relevant characteristics of either the sampled users or the larger population (Olteanu et al. 2019). These biases pose significant limitations to the use of the data due to uncertainties and cold spots. Furthermore, they raise ethical concerns, as the eBird observations may reflect patterns of redlining.\n\nHow can we address redlining when the necessary data is lacking?\n\nHow might this missing data affect the allocation of resources for disadvantaged areas?\n\nAlthough it may not be intentional, how can we bridge the socioeconomic gap among birdwatchers?\n\nScientists, policymakers, the general public, and the eBird platform should carefully consider how they utilize bird observation datasets and seek ways to improve these disparities."

    "text": "Solutions\nTo promote equitable biodiversity research and conservation, it is crucial to align scientific goals with community-led initiatives. By prioritizing the improvement of biodiversity sampling in underrepresented regions, often referred to as coldspots, and collaborating with neighborhood associations and non-governmental groups, we can encourage inclusive citizen science. Programs like STEM-focused initiatives for high school students, Black Birders Week, and Latino Outdoors are examples of how engaging marginalized communities can enhance scientific literacy and encourage broader participation in nature-based activities. Furthermore, by leveraging federal initiatives like Justice40, resources can be directed to historically underserved communities, empowering them with K-12 STEM education and promoting active involvement in conservation efforts.‚Äã Until we see a change in the data that reflects the population, tools like eBird can eventually be used to improve environmental science and policy. By embracing these strategies, we can develop a more inclusive and informed approach to biodiversity conservation."
