## Mid-Year Review

For my mid-year review, I decided to build a dashboard in Tableau to familiarize myself with the software. The platform is quite intuitive for data cleaning, creating visualizations, and formatting dashboard layouts. I successfully analyzed my streaming patterns across the first six months, including total and unique streams, my top 10 songs, top 10 artists, and the artists I consistently listened to each month.

Below, you can explore the interactive dashboard and uncover the insights I found in my streaming data. Navigate through the different visualizations for a complete view of my listening habits over the past six months, and check out the playlist I created featuring my top 10 songs!
