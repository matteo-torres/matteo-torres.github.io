Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Matteo Torres, and I am a Chicano from Wilmington, California. I recently relocated to pursue a Master's in Environmental Data Science (MEDS) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

I am interested in learning new data science skills to address complex environmental issues, particularly those related to ecology, conservation, and restoration. Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing, attending concerts, and listening to various music genres. Feel free to look around and get to know me better!
