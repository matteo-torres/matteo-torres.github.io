Hi, my name is Matteo Torres, and I am a chicano from Wilmington, CA. I recently relocated to pursue a master's in Environmental Data Science (MEDS)  at the University of California, Santa Barbara Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.


I am interested in learning new data science skills to address complex environmental issues, particularly those related to ecology, conservation, and restoration. Outside of academics, I love to dance, attend concerts, and listen to various genres of music!
