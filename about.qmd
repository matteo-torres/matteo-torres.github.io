## Background

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(sf)
library(here)
library(slickR)
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Read in Los Angeles Zip Codes shapefile
wilmington <- read_sf(here("data", "ZipCodes_3170383398510875265", "California_Zip_Codes.shp")) %>%
  filter(ZIP_CODE == 90744) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
```

I am from Wilmington, CA, a small neighborhood in the South Bay Harbor region of Los Angeles. It is located just south of the Port of Los Angeles and is surrounded by major oil refineries, including Phillips 66, Marathon, and Valero, making it the third-largest oil field in the United States.

Wilmington is predominantly a Latino, working-class community centered around industry. While the area provides job opportunities through its port and refineries, it also faces significant challenges related to pollution and health disparities. Residents are at a high risk for cancer, respiratory problems, and cardiovascular diseases. 

Growing up in this environment has motivated me to pursue a career in environmental data science, with the hope of making a meaningful impact on communities like mine that are affected by environmental racism.
